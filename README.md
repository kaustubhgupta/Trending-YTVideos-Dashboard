YouTube is not only serving as an entertainment
platform for the films and the television industry but it has
also emerged as a learning platform for many students.
Content creators on YouTube, commonly known as
“YouTubers” are pushing their content every single day and
hour to be relevant to their audiences. It’s a known fact that
the YouTube algorithm is not a publicly available code and it is
kept private for most of the time. Also, YouTube has shared
any intuition about what factors are considered for a video to
be in trending section which leaves its audience in dilemma
about posting videos. The trending section is where some
videos are listed as trending and it is designed in such a way
that every user of this platform checks it once in a while. This
dashboard aims to present the trending section of YouTube for
India in terms of the trends and observations which could be
helpful for creators to push their content to more audiences
